Sweetgreen is an e-commerce website, created as a personal project to enhance my frontend development skills. This is a personal project adapted to showcase and practice modern frontend technologies.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend** — I have used **React + TypeScript** frontend with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. I used React Router for the app structure and routing. 

**Cloud** — The web application is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)

**Versioning and Collaboration** — I used Git and GitHub for version control.
